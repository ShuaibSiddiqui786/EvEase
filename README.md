# EvEase  

EvEase is a role-based event management software designed to streamline the event approval process. It replaces the traditional paper-based approval system with a digital platform that ensures faster approvals, better accountability, and enhanced transparency.  

## Features  

  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Four distinct user roles with tailored access rights:  
  - **Club Members:** Submit event requests.  
  - **Coordinators:** Review and forward requests.  
  - **Faculty Members:** Approve or reject requests.  
  - **Administrators:** Oversee the entire workflow with advanced controls.  

- **Real-Time Status Tracking:** Keep track of event request progress at every stage.  
- **Automated Notifications:** Stay updated with email and in-app notifications.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simplified dashboards for all roles.  
- **Faster Approvals:** Reduced average processing time from 7-10 days to less than 48 hours.
